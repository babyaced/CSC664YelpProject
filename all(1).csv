This has to be one of the best culinary finds in Concord! We didn't catch our servers name but he was amazing from start to finish on recommendations and over all service.

Delicious drinks and the balsamic drizzle was to die for. We then ordered the Ruby Grapefruit Gimlet(server recommended) and it is AMAZING! We also had a wedge salad with chicken and the special which was a skirt steak with broccolini and shishido peppers and every bite was mouthwatering.

"['Amber R.', ""Elite '2020""]",['8/29/2020'],['4 star rating'],['Parkside Bar & Grill'],"[""This dining experience was genuinely so hot and cold. If you want just the overview then I'm going to chalk it up to 1.) COVID 2.) the fact that they have only been open for barely two months and 3.) Getting dinner on a busy Friday night.

"", ""Now let's \xa0just get the uglies out of the way - CONS: "", '* They were very busy and the waitstaff were spread thin so there were extended periods of time before your waiter would come back to your table.

It was so apparent that he was doing everything he could to make our experience enjoyable. ', '* I had ordered the Jadori chicken but the waiter advised they had just run out 30 minutes prior. I asked him about gluten free options and he came up with the idea of ordering The Thunderbird (which is a spicy fried chicken sandwich) with grilled chicken instead and as protein style (wrapped in lettuce). I really like that he was an on the spot problem solver. They ended up actually giving me the sandwich with bread instead of lettuce so I just tossed the buns and ate the chicken. ', '* Our waiter was the one that noticed he brought out a side order of fries so he took it upon himself to bring out the actual appetizer order, obviously free of charge.

Never been there pre-pandemic but they've got a little outdoor patio that we decided to venture out to in need of some sunshine. Sadly, we were too late for their brunch menu--which is a shame, because another guest we met there was raving about it! But the food was decent and the drinks were definitely worth a visit. I had a veggie burger and my companion had the beefier and cheesier alternative, which he liked. The veggie burger wasn't spectacular but it wasn't bad at all, just kinda mid-tier. The staff were friendly and made sure we had everything we needed, and the owner even stopped to make sure we were having a good time.

"['Chris Y.', ""Elite '2020""]",['7/31/2020'],['4 star rating'],['Parkside Bar & Grill'],"[""Parkside Bar & Grill is a new restaurant that has only been open for roughly a month now. A new restaurant opening now in it of itself is pretty gutsy, so after browsing on Yelp for a new place to eat at, I thought I'd give this place a try."", 'Located right next to Taqueria Los Dos Gallos, in the Los Todos square, it has replaced a previous bar that used to occupy this space.', ""The decor is nice as far as the outside seating is concerned (since there's no indoors currently, so I can't speak to that yet), and all the tables adequately spaced, and there's even tables on the sidewalk, so a pretty good number of tables if they do get a bit busier, which they were indeed tonight. For big parties? Possibly? But it's probably better fit for 2-4 mostly, and maybe 5-6 if you want a bigger party. More than 6 will probably be hit or miss depending on how busy they get since they don't have any larger tables."", 'The service here is great. From the hostess, to the server, to the manager, and even to the person who brought our food out from the kitchen, they were all very friendly and provided a welcoming and open atmosphere.', ""They do not have a huge variety of options on their food menu, so if you're looking for choices, it's not going to be there. But what they do have on their menu seems to touch upon at least a little bit of everything, so there's still enough there to give you options. Their drink menu here is more generous, and have a wider selection, at least the hard liquor goes."", 'Price wise they are about on par, and maybe a bit cheaper if you were to compare to some of the other spots in this busy part of Concord.', 'The food here overall was nice. Everything was well made, well portions, and delicious.', ""Appetizers we had were the calamari and the ribs. The calamari wasn't anything out of the ordinary, but is better than your typical calamari from most places as far as quality of the food. Tender, well fried, and the only thing is that it's a bit smaller than most calamari that is used, but at least it was tender, so not too much to complain about. The cocktail sauce was nice, even though I usually don't like cocktail sauce, but theirs had an extra kick to it, almost like a chili flavor added to make it a bit different. The ribs here were very nicely done. It's charred very well on both the top and the bottom of the rib that it gives off a nice crunch to it when you bite in, but as you continue to bite it, the meat is not dried and is still tender and juicy. While not a whole lot of meat on the rib, it is cooked very well."", ""Now, the entrees we had today were the scampi pasta w/shrimp, the alfredo pasta w/steak, and the chicken sliders w/fries. We'll start with the chicken sliders since it was the least appealing of them all. It was just a basic bbq chicken slider. I was hoping it'd be a bit juicier, but felt a bit dry for my liking. It wasn't bad, just wasn't great. The fries though were very nicely made, and for fries, that's usually pretty hard to do since they usually just all turn out mediocre, but these fries had a bit more texture to them, and almost had a potato wedge like feel to them, but I was eating a fry, so worked out well. The pastas were both nicely made. The scampi sauce is good, but I just wish there was more of the actual sauce as it felt a bit dry for a pasta. The alfredo sauce was great, and certainly a lot heftier portions than the scampi. Both pastas had cheese sprinkled on top too, so make sure to mix it in upon arrival if you want to make sure they're nice and melted for the meal. I think this is the one part why I wish the scampi had more sauce because mixing the cheese into that pasta didn't make much of a difference due to it not being all that hot from the lack of sauce. The shrimp here is definitely worth it, as the size of the shrimps here are not just your typical small shrimps on a skewer, but they're plump, nicely cooked, and worth the portion. The steak here is also nice, as it had plenty of the char flavor on there, which makes it that much more aromatic, so it's appreciated, and it was cooked perfectly."", ""All in all, I'd definitely recommend dropping by this new restaurant, especially if you're craving for a place to sit down at. The tables are adequately spaced apart, and all the servers were wearing masks and taking precautions as necessary. This visit wasn't without some hiccups, as there were issues with the ponzu skirt steak, in that they currently do not have it apparently, which was one of the reasons why I wanted to come here since I saw that in the pictures on Yelp. I was a bit disappointed they did not have it this time, but hopefully in my next visit I'll be able to give it a try because almost everything else here was great. And if you're worried about not having seating, they do take reservations, and no minimum party requirement, which is always a good option to offer to customers."", 'Thank you Chris!

We ordered 2 cocktails, appetizer onion rings, bacon burger, Mediterranean steak pitas and truffle fries. And we finished with the pear & plum cobbler and a glass of rose. The food was delicious! 8/10 for food. The cocktails were beautiful too. The bartender gets a 10 for presentation but both drinks were extremely heavy on ice and overall just weak. It honestly tasted more like a mocktail. I was so excited for the beautiful cocktail but when we finished I felt like we paid for a $10-12 juice. I have to give our cocktails 6/10. But I will give the cocktails another chance next time before just sticking to beer/wine. This restaurant has great food, nice patio and excellent service! So happy we gave it a try.

I thought the ingredients in the sandwich were fine, as the meat tasted pretty good, though, I do wish there was more of it as it's a bit on the skimpier side, but I'll talk a bit more about this later. The veggies and herbs were aplenty, so no particular complaints there, I do feel they could have used a bit more time pickling, as they were slightly dryer than I'd like. However, the part that I did not like, not even a little, was the bread that was used for the banh mi. This is the one ingredient of this that was just completely disappointing. The bread was very hard, and also dry. It was not a good bread unfortunately, which again, is very disappointing considering that the other parts of the banh mi was actually not bad, and I could see it being much better had it been in a better bread. In situations like these, I would usually just try to flatten the bread a little even to try and eat the sandwich, however, the bread here doesn't even flatten properly because of how hard it actually is. I don't know why the bread is this hard, either it's stale due to old stock that just needs to be used, or it's been baked way too long that's made it far too dry, either way, the bread ruined the experience for me with the banh mi, as I don't really enjoy biting into a sandwich and cutting the roof of my mouth on it."", ""Final verdict, the staff here was friendly, so no complaints there. The one thing Spicy Joi's does have down is the price, as it's cost friendly. Some of their meat dishes looks interesting, so I might be back to give them a shot in the future. While Spicy Joi's does have something to offer to this area in particular to a place specializing in banh mi, which is generally lacking in this area, there really needs to be better consideration for all ingredients in this food, not just most. I might also chalk it up to maybe I just caught them on a bad day, and the bread that came out today was just not made well, or a mistake. For a place with banh mi in the name, I may or may not try it again depending on if it's the same bread I'll be getting again next time, because it was just not up to par for a place that prides itself in their banh mi."", 'Hello Chris,', 'Thank you for your honest review.

Portion wise, were actually pretty good. Even though the portion from this takeout option will all be less than the usual plate you would get if you were to eat in, it's still a fair amount of meat per choice, and not too pricey. The meat itself will vary quite a bit though, mainly because the way the meat is cooked across the board is not well done. To be fair, the people who were hired to work here were never meant to be cooks, and mostly just doing food preparation with the occasional frying, and japchae. It will really be hit or miss depending on what you order here, and how it will come out when it's cooked. The beef items here are all hit or miss. It'll either be tender, or really overcooked. I usually quite enjoy the premium steak here, but the way it was cooked was so badly done, that it was just not enjoyable, though there was a couple of pieces that were okay, but a majority of each piece was just way too overcooked for a steak. The galbi was cooked okay, but not quite charred enough for my liking. The pork was also not quite as charred for my liking, particularly the pork cheek, which really isn't great if it's not cooked a bit more charred. The chicken was cooked perfectly, so no complaints there. Shrimp was also perfectly cooked. But unfortunately, it's very hit or miss with the consistency of what is overcooked and undercooked with the meats here. Again, not surprised since they were hired to cook the food, but now that they are, there needs to be better training on how to cook each meat differently and not just throw them all on the same grill, and assume they all just have the same cook times as it sort of felt like this time."", ""In the end, it's still not a bad deal if you're craving for a fair amount of KBBQ, and not terribly expensive. Just be mindful of how to choose your meats, as not all the meats will come out properly as mentioned previously. Not 3 stars necessarily, more like 3.5 stars, but the premium steak cooking was just too disappointing considering that's always one of my favorites, and this time that particular meat was just not well cooked, though, was still enjoyable overall.

Numerous seating options such as booth, two person, four to six, and much larger tables for bigger groups. They also have a macaroon ice cream bin at the front, but you'd have to purchase it up there at the front counter since it's a separate vendor (I know, weird)."", ""The pricing of the place is fairly straightforward for a KBBQ AYCE. It's been the same price ever since it's opened, $25 for dinner, and $17 for lunch. The lunch menu is slightly smaller than the dinner menu, with some of the more premium meats missing from the list, but most notably, the galbi isn't included, so if you were going there for galbi, make sure to not do the lunch menu, or you may be disappointed since it's kind of a staple for KBBQ, not to say, their other stuff isn't delicious."", ""The service here is generally pretty good. When they get busy, it may take a bit longer for the server to get around at times, and take awhile for them to get your order in, or to change out your grill, and replace small dishes/salad/water. Usually though, there's so many people walking around, you can flag someone else down, and they can pop in your order too, since they send the orders digitally to the back to prepare your plate, so really anyone could do it for you. The same pretty much goes for the grill change, which, usually there's a specific person who comes around with a stack of grills, ready to change multiple tables, and not just their own so you won't be stuck cooking a fully charred surface. Of course, may still take awhile at times, so just be aware that may still happen. The managers here are also all pretty friendly. I've yet to actually have a problem with the management here, as when I have had problems, they've always come by to resolve them in a responsible manner, so it's appreciated."", ""Now, let's get to the good part; the food."", ""There's a lot of items on the menu, so I'll just be going over some of my favorites from the list. Here are some of my personal recommendations from the meats: Galbi, Premium Steak, Cajun/Garlic Chicken, and the Pork Cheek. "", 'Disclaimer: Many of their other meats are good too, just not listed above or below.', ""The Galbi is delicious, as the meat is pretty good, but the flavoring of the meat is really what brings it out here. I mean, isn't that really the best part about galbi is the flavors? One thing to note though, make use of the scissors, as the fat on the galbi here is really chewy, and for those who don't want to just chew for days, or have weak teeth, I'd recommend cutting it off during the cooking to make sure you don't have to deal with that. The Premium Steak is always a good one here as well. The meat is tender, and overall just delicious. There is a downside here too though, and that their premium steaks always seem to have tendon in the middle, and unchewable sliver of fat outside, so again, will need to make use of the scissors if you're not fashioned for a marathon of chewing. Their Cajun/Garlic flavors are both delicious, so while I noted chicken for them, it'll also work with the other meats as well, so no worries there. And the surprising favorite of mine here is actually the Pork Cheek. This dish has sort of evolved throughout the time when Gen has opened. It started out at super thinly sliced pieces of the pork cheek, but it was a nightmare to cook, as they were so thin, sometimes they'd even fall through the slits of the grill. The next form were slightly bigger pieces, still thinly cut, but at least now it didn't take forever for you to pick off each piece on the plate, and was delicious once it was cooked. The most recent form from this Thursday were finely cut thicker pieces, as seen in the photos, and I must say, my favorite version of them all. The way the fat and the meat charring together, it's just so crispy and meaty as soon as you take a bite out of it."", ""Overall, Gen is a great place for you to be if you want tasty AYCE KBBQ. While it is inconsistent at times, especially when they're busy, having been here more than a handful of visits already, overall, they are fairly consistent from the service side of things, and also from the food side. Just make sure to get here early, or much later (like after 10, they open late), or else you may be in for a bit of a wait, but if you're out with a big group, might not be the worst place to be anyways.""]"

I know, some may say for as long as I have been a ""Yelper"" now that I should have plenty more reviews, but there is that thing called....""Life"" and it happens sometimes. This is going to be the first time one of my ""milestone reviews"" isn\'t a SF establishment that seemed to have been the case from the start of my journey to now me being the ""Legendary King of Gold"" I\'m actually pretty proud to highlight this very new business and do a review for them and them also being my ""400th"" review. With current events happening in the world right now, supporting ""All"" small businesses is very crucial for many to stay afloat. ""Carnes Jalisco"" is super new, and I\'m pretty sure opening a business during what\'s going on wasn\'t ideal. But lucky me I was able to catch them for their soft opening before they temporarily closed. So, another 5 Star review, this place is totally deserving of it. Allow me to tell you why ""Birria"" isn\'t just a ""Taco"" thing any longer.', '""Carnes Jalisco""', 'Location - Concord, Ca', 'Food - Birria Taco, Birria Dip, Large Horchata', 'Price - $16.31', 'Carnes Jalisco:', '""Carnes Jalisco"" I actually found out about through my ""Yelp"" compadre ""Casey C."" on ""The Gram"" (Instagram) They had opened for a soft opening on June 28th and he had posted his meal that he had there. I was all about that clout, I knew I had to go and make my mark. I decided to check out their page and liked what I saw. I directly came on ""Yelp"" right after and found their business page and bookmarked. The location sits right off the Solano exit in Concord. It sits in a small little strip mall with a ""Dollar General"" if you need a visual reference. So this establishment is very simple and not over the top and their menu also proves this which will be pictured later in the review. Now let me talk about the menu, there are only seven main items and one dessert on the menu. You have Beef (Birria Style) and Chicken as your protein options, Flan is the dessert. 3 Taco options, one being ""Keto"" a Birria styled Beef Dip, Burrito and a Quesadilla. Well I has two of the mentioned main menu items, let me tell you about what I had..', 'Birria Beef Dip $8.00 - Now this worked all the way, Birria Beef instead of your standard beef was amazing with ""Birria"" and ""Consomme"". So, if you\'ve had a ""French Dip"" or any dip sandwich, you should know the general jist of what this sandwich is. This was perfect, like ""Birria"" is already great with the tacos, but in sandwich form it holds more of the juice when you dip it. This is one of the small things in life that makes to want to hug the person that made it and tell them thank you. Simple and tasty, and made super fresh, I\'m a fan and for them being the first taqueria I\'ve saw so far with a sandwich dip varient on the menu, I will credit ""Carnes Jalisco"" with being the firsts.', 'Quesabirria $3.50 - So, as you all should know that a ""Quesabirria"" is a ""Birria Taco"" just with added cheese. Honestly the cheese hold these types of tacos together for me, although they be ""Juicy, Juicy"" and you could see it from the front and see it from the back back..ok enough with the song puns. This was good as well, I only got one because I knew the sandwich was going to fill me up. I choose the beef birria just as I had with the sandwich and it was delicious and a nice size as compared to others I\'ve had from other establishments. They filled it with a nice amount of meat, onions and other condiments. I\'m a fan of this as well.', ""Large Horchata $3.50 - Pretty good horchata, tasted pretty good. IDK if it's house made, but I still enjoyed it and think it's a nice compliment to the food here. They also have other drink options if you don't like Horchata."", 'In Closing:', 'The cool thing about this place is the fact that you get ""Consomme"" with all the main food items on the menu. The menu also is simple enough that there shouldn\'t be any real issue trying everything on the menu in a few visits. As of right now, the projected grand opening for ""Carnes Jalisco"" is set for Tuesday July 14, 2020. A ""Taco Tuesday"" is I feel a totally fitting day to try them out when they re-open. So again, they\'re a small business trying to open and prosper in a trying time. So I totally recommend checking them out when they open and if you need further convencing search for them on ""Instagram"" I highly recommend them and can\'t wait till the grand opening.']"

Also came with a medium drink. I also ordered a side order of the hummus because I have been craving it. This meal was so full of flavor, the veggies it came with were fresh and went just right with the rice and chicken. The side order of hummus is a pretty big portion for around $4 bucks so I ate it with the rest of the rice and chicken I had left over. I definitely wanted to order it again but gotta wait for my next cheat day lol. 5 stars across for the quick delivery and fresh flavorful food.""]"

The calamari itself was nice and tender. Not overcooked like some places, and just had a good texture to it. The sweet chili (may have also had fish sauce in it) was good too. Light, not too heavy.

At some points I couldn't even tell if it was beef, which was unfortunately. The chicken was okay as well. The texture was better from a meat perspective, but the flavoring was just the typical curry chicken glaze that's been BBQ. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't come back here just for it. The pork however was nicely done. Just enough fat on the meat to make it feel a bit juicier, but the glaze that they used for the pork was spot on, and just had that nice flavor to it as you chewed it.
